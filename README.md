## Branching strategy
There is 4 types of branches that I am going to implement including the main branch.
    main brach: The branch for the final product or project. All the branches starts with the main branch and will branch out for safety reasons. When all the tasks are finished they   will be merged back to the main branch.
    
    Readme branch: This a branch only spesefic for the readme file. If there is going to be changes on this file it will be don on this branch and after it will be merge back to the main branch.
    
    HotFix branch: This is a branch that is going to be used only when there is a problem on the main branch or on any other branch that needs Fix in Code or in documentation that causes problems to the main branch will be fixed in this branch only.
    
    Develop branch: This is the branch that is going to be used the mos often, because of the changes of the project. After every section of the code will push and there will be a short or brief discription of the changes that was made.

## provide a diagram explaining project and repository context and how they are integrated

## Use of a .gitignore file
    The .gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository.

## explain the storage of credentials and sensitive information
    Store Credentials:
        Github uses an Authentication token or Personal access token (PAT). It is the alternative to usising a password.
    Store Sensitive Information:
        Github uses thightly control access to protect your information like using two factor authentication. 
        The user uses SSH keys or PAT to gain access to his/her informations or repositories.
